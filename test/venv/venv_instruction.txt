Copy venv from https://gitlab.jsc.fz-juelich.de/MLDL_FZJ/juhaicu/jsc_public/sharedspace/teaching/intro_scalable_dl_2021/course2021_working_environment 
Read file with requirements for my code and try to find module for every dependency using "module spider pytorch". Append the file modules.sh in the venv directory. 
Write down packages that were not found as module to the requirements.txt. 
Run "sh setup.sh"
Run "source activate.sh"
-> This should load modules and activate the venv.  You should see a prompt with your venv name.
Run "create_kernel.sh"
-> Should create the kernel file.
Go to control panel, stop current jupyter lab connection and start it over. 
-> Logout-login required
Submit sh files "sbatch job.sh" where there is written "source " and path to the venv.
Yes, for jobs you need to activate (the same activate.sh as in point 5).
